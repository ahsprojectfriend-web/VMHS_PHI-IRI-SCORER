After World War II, Filipinos changed the old jeeps left by American soldiers into public vehicles. Today, these brightly colored jeepneys ply every street of the Philippines. Its design is a constant reminder of the Filipinos’ creativity and resourcefulness.\n\nNot only that it is a sight to behold, these jeepneys have been so useful to the mass of Filipinos ever since its inception as a public vehicle. As proof, all throughout the Philippines, there are designated routes and numerous locations for passengers to board and disembark. It’s another thing to be inside the jeepneys. Passengers sit facing each other, making conversations more enjoyable. Hence, for many Filipinos, riding the jeepneys offers them time to socialize conveniently with one another, especially in cities where traffic is unbearable.\n\nHowever, the Filipinos’ beloved jeepney is in danger of being off the road in the near future. According to the government, they want to make the jeepneys safer and better for the environment. They plan to replace old jeepneys with new ones that use electricity or less fuel. The drivers are worried because they might not have enough money to buy these new vehicles as they are more expensive than the old jeepneys.\n\nEven with this threat, the jeepney remains an important part of every Filipino’s life. Long after the Americans have left Philippine soil, its practicality and usefulness continue. People use jeepneys for varied reasons: to go around, visit friends and relatives, go to work, and see new places. It is hard to imagine how life can go on for an ordinary Filipino without the jeepneys. The plan to replace them should be thoughtfully considered.", questions: [

It is like having a big town square where everyone can share news and stories instantly. Social media through the Internet has figuratively made the world smaller. All one needs is a gadget. It may be a smartphone, a tablet, or a laptop. Desktops can still be used. Through these devices, people can connect with friends and family members who may be on the far side of the globe.\n\nWhat is even more amazing is that we can make friends from practically everywhere on the planet. It is relatively easy to find common interests because we can easily make exchanges. We can choose to chat or make video calls using a platform of our choice. There is Messenger, Viber, and WhatsApp, to name a few. Chatting has gone a long way since Yahoo Messenger and Skype. And if we want people to be updated about us, there is Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\nPersonal communication is not the only one that has changed. Even businesses turn to social media and digital networks to promote and sell their products and to connect with prospective clients and business partners. The Internet becomes a convenient venue for posting business advertisements as it has a wider reach.\n\nBut we are always warned about the dangers of communicating through the Internet. The information that we share becomes public and can be re-shared in either a positive or negative way. We have heard and read about people who become victims of malicious sharing of photos and videos.\n\nWhile we enjoy the ease and convenience of communicating through social media, we should also be aware of these threats.

        9: { title: "THE RISE OF AI IN EDUCATION", text: "Artificial Intelligence or AI refers to technologies and systems that can accomplish tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, and solving problems. AI has brought both major opportunities and notable challenges within the education framework.\n\nPersonalized learning is AI’s main benefit. Students’ performances can be analyzed by an AI-based platform, which then determines their learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses and adjusts teaching strategies based on the evaluation. This is helpful when a student needs further preparation or additional lessons in subjects where they are struggling. This increases the effectiveness and inclusivity of education by enabling students to learn at their own pace. AI also saves teachers time by allowing them to automatically grade papers, manage calendars, and respond to basic student questions—tasks that would otherwise require a significant amount of their valuable time.\n\nThere are also disadvantages in using AI in teaching. Student dependence on AI may cause delays in developing critical and creative thinking as well as problem-solving skills. If AI provides solutions too quickly, students may miss out on the learning process. Moreover, AI lacks human emotional intelligence. It gives instant feedback but cannot provide encouragement, empathy, or understanding in the same way that a human teacher can.\n\nIt is common knowledge that AI has the ability to transform education through individualized instruction, adaptive assessments, and improved administrative efficiency. AI-powered technologies can assess large volumes of student data to customize learning paths and instructional materials, potentially increasing student engagement and academic performance. AI can also improve accessibility by offering real-time translation and accommodations for students with disabilities, thereby promoting inclusivity in learning environments around the world.\n\nDespite these advantages, the possible disadvantages and ethical concerns surrounding AI in education should not be ignored. Critics argue that excessive reliance on AI may reduce the value of human teachers, who play a vital role in facilitating face-to-face interactions essential for holistic education. Concerns such as data privacy, biased grading systems, and the digital divide—where not all students have equal access to AI tools—must also be addressed.\n\nDespite the challenges brought by AI in education, there are exciting possibilities. AI can enhance engagement through interactive tools, personalized learning experiences, and valuable data to improve instruction. The challenge lies in integrating AI in a way that complements rather than replaces the essential human aspects of teaching. Ultimately, the key is finding a balance between technological innovation and preserving the critical role teachers play in student growth.", questions: [

        10: { title: "EXPLORING NON-MENDELIAN GENETICS", text: "Non-Mendelian genetics encompasses inheritance patterns that deviate from the traditional dominant and recessive allele framework established by Gregor Mendel through his experiments with pea plants. While Mendelian genetics laid the foundation for understanding heredity, many traits in living organisms exhibit more complex inheritance patterns. By exploring non-Mendelian concepts, we gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity of genetic traits present in nature.\n\nOne significant form of non-Mendelian inheritance is incomplete dominance. In this pattern, the offspring display a phenotype that is a blend of traits from both parents. For example, crossing a red flower (RR) with a white flower (WW) results in pink offspring (RW). This shows that neither allele is completely dominant, leading to an intermediate expression of traits.\n\nAnother non-Mendelian concept is codominance, which occurs when both alleles in a heterozygous individual are fully expressed. A well-known example can be seen in certain chicken breeds where black feathers (B) and white feathers (W) are codominant. When crossed, the offspring display both black and white feathers, demonstrating that both alleles contribute equally to the phenotype.\n\nPolygenic inheritance is another type of non-Mendelian inheritance in which multiple genes influence a single trait. Traits such as human height and skin color are controlled by several genes working together. This results in a wide range of phenotypes rather than distinct categories, illustrating the complexity of genetic inheritance beyond simple dominant-recessive relationships.\n\nAdditionally, extranuclear inheritance involves genes located outside the nucleus, primarily in mitochondria or chloroplasts. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother and can result in traits or diseases that do not follow Mendelian patterns. This type of inheritance helps explain certain genetic conditions passed down through maternal lines.\n\nUnderstanding non-Mendelian genetics is essential in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and evolutionary biology. Recognizing that some genetic traits and disorders arise from multiple genes rather than a single gene improves approaches to treatment, prevention, and research. Overall, non-Mendelian genetics enriches our understanding of heredity and explains the complexity and diversity of life.", questions: [
